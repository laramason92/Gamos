*** G4Exception : Run0041
      issued by : G4UserRunAction::G4UserRunAction()
 You are instantiating G4UserRunAction BEFORE your G4VUserPhysicsList is
instantiated and assigned to G4RunManager.
 Such an instantiation is prohibited by Geant4 version 8.0. To fix this problem,
please make sure that your main() instantiates G4VUserPhysicsList AND
set it to G4RunManager before instantiating other user action classes
such as G4UserRunAction.
